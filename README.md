## PROBLEM

When a natural disaster strikes, loss of life and casualties are inevitable. Due to the chaos and communication issues it becomes difficult to provide medical services to a patient in need and vice versa. Delay in providing treatment to the casualties can potentially increases the number of lives lost. Hence it is necessary to reduce the time and communication gap between patients and medical facilities. Moreover, accommodating a large number of patients and getting required facilities like blood donors etc. during emergency situations becomes a difficult task for hospitals.

So here we introduce our idea of an easily accessible mobile application to help facilitate better communication and create contact between doctors, the injured and common people.

## SOLUTION

The mobile application will have the following features:
- Pre â€“ registered doctors, private and government hospitals and local nursing homes with their address and contact information. The app will also have details regarding what services each hospital provides etc.
- During a natural calamity the app will provide real time communication between local people and the health service providers. 
- A map consisting of all the hospitals making it easy for the users to easily figure out which hospital is the most accessible one.
- Hospitals can portray which facilities they have in working conditions so that the smaller medical camps set-up will be able to refer the patients to the appropriate private /government hospitals and nursing homes.
- Common people who are in a position to help out others can also put up their location on this app along with details such as blood group. So that the people in need as well as the hospitals can contact them during emergency.
